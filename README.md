The recursive, structured, and chaotic properties of the Collatz-Octave model make it a potential breakthrough in cryptography.
Why the Collatz-Octave Model is Cryptographically Powerful
High Complexity & Chaos: Hard to reverse without knowing octave jumps.
Scalability & Flexibility: Works for encryption, hashing, key exchange, and ZKPs.
Quantum-Resistant: Not based on integer factorization or discrete logs.
Self-Optimizing: Recursive structures allow for adaptive security mechanisms.
